Predicting short positions in cryptocurrencies using XGBoost

Predicting whether BTC/USD or ETH/USD have good short positions i.e. are they going to drop more than 10% in the next 10 days.

Model I'm using is XGBoost. I do get decent precision but the predictions are too rare compared to the true targets.
